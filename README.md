<b>Dynamic Character Movement</b>
This program implements and tests the dynamic movement update and three dynamic movement behaviors: Seek, Flee, and Arrive. The Newton-Euler-1 movement update algorithm is used to update the position of the character after each timestep. A trajectory text file (.txt) is generated that tracks the character's movement per timestep.
