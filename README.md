<b>Dynamic Character Movement</b>
<br>This program implements and tests the dynamic movement update and three dynamic movement behaviors: Seek, Flee, and Arrive. The Newton-Euler-1 movement update algorithm is used to update the position of the character after each timestep. A trajectory text file (.txt) is generated that tracks the character's movement per timestep. </br>

<br><b>Features</b></br>
  - <b>Insertion:</b> Adds new elements while maintaining the BST property.
  - <b>Search:</b> Quickly locates elements using the binary search algorithm.
  - <b>Deletion:</b> Removes elements, including handling edge cases like nodes with two children.
  - <b>Insertion:</b> Supports in-order, pre-order, and post-order tree traversals.
